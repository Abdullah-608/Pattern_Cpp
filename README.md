# 🎨 Pattern Playground: Make Cool Shapes with Code! 🌟  

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to the **Pattern Playground**, where you can use code to make **amazing shapes and patterns** with numbers, letters, and stars. Even a five-year-old can enjoy this magic! 🪄✨  

---

## 🧩 What Can You Do?  

With this program, you can create all kinds of shapes:  
- 🟦 **Squares** with numbers, letters, or stars!  
- 🔺 **Triangles** that grow bigger and bigger!  
- 🌟 **Diamonds**, **pyramids**, and even a **butterfly**! 🦋  
- 🎄 A beautiful **tree** for the holidays!  
- 🚤 A cool **boat** pattern to sail away!  

All you need to do is tell the program what you want, and it will draw it for you!

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the size of the pattern you want (just a number like **3**, **5**, or **10**).  
3. Pick your favorite pattern from the list (like stars, triangles, or letters).  
4. Watch the magic happen! 🎉
